# BSD Feedback

## What is this?

It is a web application that allows users to enter their concerns to be shared with the
Burlingame School District superintendent.

COVID-19 takes a toll on all of us, and requires expedient decisions to be taken.

In the case of the BSD, while I'm sure they are doing their best, many involved are either:

1. Not comfortable sending their children to school with what we know are the plans and contingency
   plans
2. Are not comfortable working in such a teaching environment
3. Are not happy with the Distance Learning options proposed so far

This website's purpose is to collect that feedback and send it to the superintendent to make our
voices heard.

## How is it made?

It is made using the App Engine Go runtime. The data storage is Cloud Firestore in Datastore mode.

It's pretty great.
